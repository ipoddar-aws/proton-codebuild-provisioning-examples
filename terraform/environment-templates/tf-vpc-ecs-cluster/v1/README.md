## Description

This  template creates a VPC with two public and private subnets across two availability zones. The VPC includes an Internet Gateway and a managed NAT Gateway in each public subnet as well as VPC Route Tables that allow for communication between the public and private subnets.

It also deploys an ECS cluster to group your fargate tasks and services. An ECS task execution role is created to allow tasks to pull container images from an ECR private repository, and send container logs to CloudWatch Logs.

Note that this template creates its own S3 bucket to be used for storing Terraform remote state. The bucket is outputted so that associated Proton service templates can use it as well.  In this way, the IaC state for each environment instance along with its related services are all stored in a single bucket.
